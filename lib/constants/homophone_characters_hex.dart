/// A list of hexadecimal representations of Amharic homophone characters.
///
/// This list contains the hexadecimal values of all Amharic characters that have homophones.
/// The characters are arranged in groups of 7, with each group representing a different homophone set.
///
/// **Example:**
///
/// The first 7 characters in the list represent the homophones of the character with hexadecimal value `1210`.
/// These characters are:
///
/// * `1210` ሐ
/// * `1211` ሑ
/// * `1212` ሒ
/// * `1213` ሓ
/// * `1214` ሔ
/// * `1215` ሕ
/// * `1216` ሖ
///
/// The next 7 characters represent the homophones of the character with hexadecimal value `1280`, and so on.
///
/// **Note:**
///
/// This list is used by the `amharic_homophones` package to convert Amharic text with homophones to a normalized form.
